You can place Share Buttons, Related Content and any other Shareaholic app manually wherever you're like. Simply insert the following Shortcode where you want the corresponding app to appear:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="total_share_count"]`

Notes: optionally, you can also specify `title`, `link` or `summary` as Shareaholic shortcode parameters. If you don't specify these optional  parameters, the shortcode will automatically determine these values.

Example:

`[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>" title="About Me" link="http://mysite.com/about"]`

In your PHP / theme template code, you would add:

`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`

`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>"]'); ?>`

Grab the corresponding App ID from your Shareaholic Dashboard for the App you want to manually insert into your theme. If use double quotes ("'s) in your title or summary, make sure to encode them properly as `&quot;`

Shareaholic Shortcode's are full featured and support all available configuration options available. Enjoy!
